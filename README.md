ESP8266WiFi.h: Used to connect the ESP8266 to Wi-Fi.
BlynkSimpleEsp8266.h: Blynk library to send data to the Blynk platform.
Soil moisture sensor: Reads the moisture level of the soil. The value is analog, and you can define a threshold based on your sensor calibration.
Relay: Controls the water pump. When the moisture level is below the threshold, the pump turns on. Otherwise, it stays off.
Blynk.virtualWrite(V1, moistureLevel): Sends the moisture level to the Blynk app to monitor data remotely.
These  are the sensors used in our project
steps of working are as follows :
Power On the System:

Once powered on, the system initializes the microcontroller (Arduino/ESP8266/ESP32), soil moisture sensor, and relay module for the water pump.
The microcontroller establishes a Wi-Fi connection using the credentials provided in the code.
Wi-Fi and IoT Platform Setup:

The microcontroller (ESP8266/ESP32) connects to the internet via Wi-Fi.
It authenticates with the IoT platform (e.g., Blynk, ThingSpeak, Firebase) using an authentication token or API key.
Soil Moisture Measurement:

The soil moisture sensor continuously measures the moisture level in the soil.
It outputs an analog signal that is read by the microcontroller (analogRead on the designated pin).
Data Processing:

The measured soil moisture level is compared against a predefined threshold value.
If the soil moisture is below the threshold (indicating dry soil), the system decides to turn on the water pump.
If the soil moisture is above the threshold (indicating wet soil), the system turns off the water pump.
Water Pump Control:

If the soil is dry (moisture level below the threshold):
The microcontroller sends a signal to the relay, turning it ON, which in turn powers the water pump.
The water pump irrigates the soil until the moisture level rises above the threshold.
If the soil is sufficiently moist (moisture level above the threshold):
The microcontroller sends a signal to turn the relay OFF, cutting power to the water pump and stopping irrigation.
Data Transmission to IoT Platform:

The current soil moisture reading is transmitted to the IoT platform (Blynk, ThingSpeak, etc.) in real-time.
This allows users to monitor soil moisture levels remotely from a smartphone or a web interface.
The data is visualized using graphs or displayed as raw values on the dashboard.
Real-Time Monitoring and Control:

Users can monitor the soil moisture data via the IoT platform from anywhere in the world.
Some platforms (like Blynk) also allow manual control of the water pump through the app, giving users the ability to start/stop irrigation remotely.
Automatic Operation:

The system operates continuously, checking the soil moisture at regular intervals (e.g., every 2 seconds).
It automatically turns the water pump on/off based on the current soil moisture level, ensuring the plants are properly irrigated without over-watering.
User Interaction (Optional):

If desired, users can receive alerts or notifications on their smartphones whenever the moisture level falls below or rises above certain levels.
They can manually override the automatic irrigation system by controlling the relay through the IoT app.
Continuous Feedback Loop:

The system maintains a continuous loop where it monitors the soil moisture, processes the data, controls the water pump, and sends the data to the cloud for monitoring and logging.
